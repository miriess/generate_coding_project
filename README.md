# Generating a consistent folder structure for (data science) projects
Following [this blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-keep-your-research-projects-organized-part-1-folder-structure-10bd56034d3a) and inspired by a YouTube video (I'll try to find and link it) this script generates a standardized folder structure to house data science projects in a tidy manner. Can also be used for other coding work, but might be experimental there. Will soon also include automated github introduction.

## Motivation
Introducing a standardized folder structure helps organize the thoughts and it is a nice way to work with system and api structures. I will use it myself and keep it up-to-date here.

## Features
*What does it do and why is that awesome?*

## Code Example
*Show how the project does what it does.*

## How to use?
*What to do to use it - concise and direct.*
